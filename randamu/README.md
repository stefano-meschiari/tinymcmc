randamu is a small MIT-licensed C library that includes a high-quality random
number generator. The code is based on WELL1024, a new random generator with a
better distribution than the mersenne twister, and is tested against a sequence
generated by the authors of the algorithm (which includes the creator of the
mersenne twister). The algorithm was first presented in:

    F.O. Panneton, P. L'Ecuyer, and M. Matsumoto. "Improved long-period
    generators based on linear recurrences modulo 2" ACM Transactions on
    Mathematical Software 32 (1): 1â€“16, 2006.

Other functions and algorithms related to probability theory and statistics are
also included. The bogosort algorithm is a joke (don't use it!), but everything
else is not.

Installing
----------
On Linux or UNIX-like systems:

    $ git clone https://github.com/PhDP/randamu.git
    $ cd randamu
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

To launch tests simply add:

    $ make test

after 'make'.

You can generate Visual Studio project files with cmake, which can
be installed with [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), and using the
command

    $ cmake .

at the root of the randamu directory. To run the tests, simply build
the RUN_TESTS project in Visual Studio.

Usage
-----

``` C
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <randamu/rng.h>

int main() {
  const clock_t start = clock();
  rd_rng r; // A random number generator.
  rd_rng_init_time(&r); // Initialize with the current time.
  const int max = 2000000000;
  int success = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < max; ++i) {
    // Creates points in the unit square:
    const double x = rd_rng_double(&r);
    const double y = rd_rng_double(&r);
    // Tests if they are within the unit circle:
    success += (x * x + y * y) < 1.0;
  }
  // Print estimate of pi:
  printf("Pi ~= %f!\n", 4.0 * success / max);
  printf("Time: %.4f seconds.\n", ((double)(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC));
  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

...will compile with:

    $ clang -Wall -std=c99 -O2 random.c -o random -lrandamu -lm

Of course 'gcc' or another compiler can be used. On an Intel Core i7-4702HQ
with clang 3.5, this code takes 21.8164 seconds, a ~9% improvement over gsl
with the mersenne twister, and you don't need to adopt the GPL license.
